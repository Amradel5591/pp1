        <h2>How to start practicing moving meditation in 8 simple steps</h2>

        <p class="p-head">
          Learning how to practice moving meditation can be simple and
          enjoyable. The goal of moving meditation is to connect with yourself
          and find a sense of peace. With regular practice, moving meditation
          can become a rewarding and enriching part of your daily routine.
        </p>

        <ol class="moving-list">
          <li><h3>Choose a quiet space</h3></li>
          <p>
            Find a place where you won't be disturbed. It could be a room in
            your house, a quiet corner in your garden, or a peaceful spot in a
            park. A calm environment can help you focus and enhance your
            meditation experience.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Wear comfortable clothing</h3></li>
          <p>
            Comfort is key in moving meditation, so put on clothes that allow
            you to move freely. Don’t worry about picking out the perfect
            workout set—as long as you feel cozy in the clothing that you are
            wearing, you are ready to begin.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Start with deep breaths</h3></li>
          <p>
            Before you begin moving, take a few deep breaths. Tuning in to your
            breath helps center your mind and prepare your body. Focus on the
            sensation of air filling your lungs and then slowly leaving your
            body.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Move naturally</h3></li>
          <p>
            Begin your chosen form of moving meditation, whether it’s walking,
            stretching, or another activity. Move at a pace that feels right for
            you, so it feels natural and not forced.
          </p>

          <li><h3>Pay attention to your body</h3></li>
          <p>
            Notice how your body feels as you move. If you’re stretching, be
            aware of the stretch in your muscles. If you’re walking, feel your
            feet touching the ground. Having awareness of your body helps keep
            your mind present and engaged.
          </p>

          <li><h3>Focus on your breath</h3></li>
          <p>
            Your breath is a key part of moving meditation. Try to synchronize
            your movements with your breathing. In yoga, for example, you might
            inhale as you reach up and exhale as you fold forward.
          </p>

          <li><h3>Return to the moment</h3></li>
          <p>
            If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to
            your movement and breath. It's normal for thoughts to drift, but the
            practice is about returning to the present moment.
          </p>

          <li><h3>Finish with gratitude</h3></li>
          <p>
            At the end of your session, take a moment to be thankful for the
            time you spent in meditation. Appreciating your practice can leave
            you feeling positive and refreshed.

   Sit comfortably. Find a spot that gives you a stable, solid, comfortable seat.

Notice what your legs are doing. If on a cushion, cross your legs comfortably in front of you. If on a chair, rest the bottoms of your feet on the floor.

Straighten your upper body—but don’t stiffen. Your spine has natural curvature. Let it be there.

Notice what your arms are doing. Situate your upper arms parallel to your upper body. Rest the palms of your hands on your legs wherever it feels most natural.

Soften your gaze. Drop your chin a little and let your gaze fall gently downward. It’s not necessary to close your eyes. You can simply let what appears before your eyes be there without focusing on it.

Feel your breath. Bring your attention to the physical sensation of breathing: the air moving through your nose or mouth, the rising and falling of your belly, or your chest.

Notice when your mind wanders from your breath. Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. Don’t worry. There’s no need to block or eliminate thinking. When you notice your mind wandering gently return your attention to the breath.

Be kind about your wandering mind. You may find your mind wandering constantly—that’s normal, too. Instead of wrestling with your thoughts, practice observing them without reacting. Just sit and pay attention. As hard as it is to maintain, that’s all there is. Come back to your breath over and over again, without judgment or expectation.

When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.







A step-by-step guide to mantra meditation
Step 1
Select a favorite word, phrase, prayer, or fragment of a poem for meditation. Ideally, a mantra is composed of only a few words or syllables, so you can repeat it easily, without getting lost in a long phrase. Choose something uplifting that inspires you and engages your heart. Avoid words that stir up thoughts or disturb your mind.

Step 2
Sit comfortably in a chair or on the floor, supporting your posture with a blanket or a cushion. Find a position both aligned with the natural curves of the spine and relaxed, so you can remain fairly still. Close your eyes and take a few slow, deep breaths or do some breathing practices for several minutes, then relax your breath completely.

Step 3
Repeat your mantra slowly and steadily, concentrating on its sound as fully as you can. Repeat it in unison with the natural rhythm of your breath. Either split it so you repeat half the mantra when you inhale and the other half when you exhale, or repeat it on both the inhalation and the exhalation.

Step 4
After about 10 recitations, repeat the mantra silently by moving only your lips (this helps you keep a steady pace). Then, after another 10 repetitions, recite it internally without moving your lips.


Step 5
As thoughts arise, simply return to the mantra, knowing this is a natural part of the process. Gently bring your attention back again and again, experiencing the internal sound as fully as possible.

Step 6
Continue for the period of time you set aside for meditation. Come out of the meditation by taking a few deep breaths and then sitting quietly to see what you feel. You may feel calm and centered. Or you may be flooded with old thoughts and feelings from your subconscious, which might be uncomfortable.

Regardless of your immediate reaction, take comfort in knowing that regular practice has immense benefits: It enables you to experience the present moment more fully and to make conscious choices instead of falling into habitual reactions.









Safe place visualization exercise
This visualization exercise is designed to help you create a mental sanctuary—a place where you can retreat whenever you need a moment of peace and relaxation. 

This can be useful if you’re undergoing stress at home, or at work, or if you’ll be moving into a stressful chapter of life such as, having a child, caring for an elderly family member, moving, starting a new job, etc.

Here's how to do it:

Find a comfortable position: Start by finding a quiet, comfortable place where you won't be disturbed. Sit or lie down in a position that feels relaxed and comfortable for you.

Close your eyes and breathe: Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Feel your body relax with each exhale. 

Visualize your safe place: Now, imagine a place where you feel completely safe and relaxed. This could be a real place you've been to, like a waterfall or a childhood home, or somewhere you create in your mind, like a cozy cabin in the woods. Picture every detail of this place—the sights, the sounds, the smells. Breathe deeply as you imagine this place.

Engage your senses: Try to engage all your senses in this visualization. Consider what you might see, hear, smell, touch, and taste. The more realistic the visualization, the more engaging the experience will be.

Feel the safety and relaxation: Allow yourself to feel completely at ease in this place. Feel the safety, the peace, the relaxation. Let these feelings wash over you, soothing any stress or tension. If you have the urge to smile, smile. If you have the urge to cry, let those tears fall. Feel the place; feel the moment.

Stay in the moment: Allow yourself to stay in this moment for as long as you like. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the visualization.

Return to reality: When you're ready, slowly bring your awareness back to your physical surroundings. Wiggle your fingers and toes, take a few more deep breaths, then gently open your eyes.

Remember, this safe place is always there for you whenever you need peace. With practice, you can retreat to this place easily, helping you maintain a sense of calm and relaxation in your daily life.

2. Color breathing
This technique involves visualizing a color as you breathe in and out. Each color represents a different emotion or sensation, allowing you to cultivate specific feelings during meditation. For example, you might visualize the color blue to promote calm and relaxation or orange to evoke energy and passion. 

You might also visualize yourself breathing in warm white light and breathing out any cold darkness that might represent your stress, frustration, or anger with a situation.

3. Loving-kindness meditation
This practice involves visualizing someone you care about and sending them positive thoughts and wishes. It's a great way to cultivate compassion and empathy. You might picture a loved one, a friend, or even a  stranger. The key is to send them positive thoughts and wishes, such as happiness, health, and peace. 

This visualization can be especially powerful if you’re working towards forgiving someone in your life. Part of this practice also includes directing friendliness and warmth towards yourself too, which can be a great way to develop self-compassion. 

💙 If this practice feels a bit uncomfortable, try our Loving-Kindness session with Tamara Levitt for step-by-step guidance and support. 

4. Visualization with affirmations
An affirmation helps you focus and keep your thoughts from wandering off. Choose your favorite affirmations and repeat it to yourself as you visualize. It can be as easy as "I choose joy" or "I am enough, just as I am." 

As you silently repeat your affirmation, visualize each word slowly materializing before you and then gently floating away. For the mantra "let it be," picture the words "let"... "it"... "be" individually forming in the air, then dissipating. This engages both verbal and visual processing.

5. Guided imagery meditation 
Guided imagery meditations talk you through envisioning a relaxing setting, situation, or location using all your senses. Calm offers guided imagery options like A Woodland Stroll to Sleep that lead you through a tranquil nature scenario. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced meditator, you can find a visualization meditation that's right for you.


6. Candle flame meditation
Focus on picturing a candle flame in your mind. Visualize the center of the flame, the blues and whites. Imagine its shape-shifting subtly, its glow brightening and dimming rhythmically. Allow this dynamic yet simple visualization to anchor your attention. 

💙 You could even combine this technique with a fun breathing exercise like Birthday Candle Meditation with Emiko Susilo.

7. Body scan meditation
This exercise involves focusing on the flow of energy within your body, promoting a sense of balance and vitality. It not only helps to cultivate mindfulness and body awareness but can reduce stress too. It’s also a handy tool to use at bedtime when it’s time to signal to your body that rest is near. 

Here’s how to practice a body scan meditation that incorporates visualization:

Visualize warm, healing energy or light entering the top of your head and slowly moving down through your body. Imagine this energy traveling through each body part, from your head to your toes. Feel the energy soothing any tension or discomfort, promoting relaxation and wellbeing. 

💙 Try this short body scan meditation. 

8. Creative visualization
This practice involves visualizing your desires or goals as if you've already achieved them. It's a powerful way to boost your motivation and confidence. You might picture yourself acing a presentation, running a marathon, or completing a personal goal. The key is to visualize the goal in as much detail as possible, including how it feels to achieve it. 

You can also choose an aspiration, like cultivating more kindness, or patience, or even a more positive outlook. Develop a mental scene representing this dream realized - perhaps you see yourself reacting to others with patience, speaking gently, and emanating warmth. 

Creative visualization plants the seeds in the mind for achieving your visions. With consistency, these seeds can sprout into real-world changes.

Visualization can spark motivation and success. 

Blind paralympic athlete Lex Gillete has spoken about using visualization to achieve success and how, even though he can’t see the long jump events he’s running, by visualizing the space, the crowds, and himself in it, he feels as if he’s actually seeing it as it occurs. He describes those visualizations as strong enough to get him out of bed with excitement each day.
