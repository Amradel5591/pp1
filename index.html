            <p>Mindfulness meditation originates from Buddhist teachings and is the most popular and researched form of meditation in the West.

                In mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass through your mind. You don’t judge the thoughts or become involved with them. You simply observe and take note of any patterns.
                
                This practice combines concentration with awareness. You may find it helpful to focus on an object or your breath while you observe any bodily sensations, thoughts, or feelings.
                
                This type of meditation is good for people who don’t have a teacher to guide them, as it can be easily practiced alone.</p>

        <p>

            Although most people think of yoga when they hear movement meditation, this practice may include:
<ol class="mov-med-ex">


    <li>walking</li> 
    <li> gardening</li>  
    <li>qi gong</li>   
    <li> tai chi</li>  
    <li>other gentle forms of movement</li>   

</ol>
          
            This is an active form of meditation where the movement guides you into a deeper connection with your body and the present moment.
            
            Movement meditation is good for people who find peace in action and want to develop body awareness.

       <details> <summary  class="mantra meditation">  <h3>  Mantra Meditation  </h3></summary> <p> Mantra meditation is prominent in many teachings, including Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This type of meditation uses a repetitive sound to clear the mind. It can be a word, phrase, or sound, one of the most common being “om.”

        Your mantra can be spoken loudly or quietly. After chanting the mantra for some time, you’ll be more alert and in tune with your environment. This allows you to experience deeper levels of awareness.
        
        Some people enjoy mantra meditation because they find it easier to focus on a word than on their breath. Others enjoy feeling the vibration of the sound in their body.
        
        This is also a good practice for people who don’t like silence and enjoy repetition.</p> </details>
      





          
        
        <details>  <summary  class="visualization meditation">   <h3>  Visualization Meditation  </h3>  </summary>
            <p> Visualization meditation is a technique focused on enhancing feelings of relaxation, peace, and calmness by visualizing positive scenes, images, or figures.
    
                This practice involves imagining a scene vividly and using all five senses to add as much detail as possible. It can also involve holding a beloved or honored figure in mind with the intention of embodying their qualities.
                
                Another form of visualization meditation involves imagining yourself succeeding at specific goals, which is intended to increase focus and motivation.
                
                Many people use visualization meditation to boost their mood, reduce stress levels, and promote inner peace. </p>
